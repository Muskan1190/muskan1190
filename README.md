## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Business Analyst blending business logic with data science to craft meaningful stories through numbers. With a flair for exploration and a habit of consistent learning, I enjoy building tools that simplify decision-making — for people and machines.

I’m also:
- 🤖 Diving deep into **machine learning** and **deep learning**
- 📈 Obsessed with making dashboards *that speak*
- 🌍 Curious about how data changes lives, industries, and even languages
- 🇫🇷 A French enthusiast who loves cross-cultural communication

## 🤩 Fun Fact

> I once created a machine learning project **and explained it as if I was teaching it to a 7-year-old** – because simplicity is the ultimate sophistication!

## 🚧 Projects I'm Proud Of

| Project | Tools | Highlights |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction** | Python, XGBoost, Scikit-learn | Analyzed patient data to predict recurrence risk using interpretable ML. |
| **Books to Scrape (Web Scraping Project)** | BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas | Scraped and analyzed 1000+ books by price, genre, and ratings. |
| **Deep Learning Kickstart** | TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib | Learning image classification with CNNs on toy datasets like MNIST/CIFAR-10.
